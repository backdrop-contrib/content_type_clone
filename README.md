HOW TO USE
----------
After having installed and enabled the module, follow the steps below:

 1. Go to the content type list (admin/structure/types).
  
 2. Click on the "clone" list next to the content type you want to clone.
  
 3. In the form that will appear, provide a name, a machine name and 
    a description (optional) for the new content type 
    that is about to be created.
   
 4. Click "Generate". The cloned content type will then appear 
    in the content type list.

Cloning options:
When cloning a content type, there are 2 self explanatory options 
in the creation form.

 * Copy all nodes from the source content type to the target content type
 	
 * Delete all nodes from the source content type after 
   they have been copied to the target content type
